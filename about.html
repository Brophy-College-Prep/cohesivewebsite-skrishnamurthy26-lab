  <p>Seb is a student at Brophy college Preparatory. He is on varisty archery and is a master with the bow.</p>
  <p>He claims that he goes to all the Spanish Honor Society meetings. However, I have never seen him there any single time that I go. And yet, he is the president and I have no leadership. Makes no sense</p>
  <p>He is Peruvian and went to Mach Pichu during the Peru immersion trip.</p>
  <p>He has a chocolate printer that she showed off for AP research and it was very delicious chocolate. He made the chocolate printer because he would rather engineer ways to eat then walk to the gym.</p>
