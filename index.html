  <p>Seb never goes to the gym because he’s “bulking,” but the only thing getting bigger is his list of excuses.</p>
  <p>He heard there’s something called leg day and decided that was a red flag. His favorite gym machine is the vending machine, and his cardio routine is running late, running his mouth, and running from responsibilities.</p>
  <p>He’s on a strict program: three sets of “I’ll start Monday” with unlimited rest days. Every time someone says “just do one more rep,” Seb disappears like it’s a magic trick. He goes to the gym religiously: once every few months, just to keep the streak alive.</p>
  <p>Later pages will have an about section so you can get to know Seb and videos of the gym.</p>
